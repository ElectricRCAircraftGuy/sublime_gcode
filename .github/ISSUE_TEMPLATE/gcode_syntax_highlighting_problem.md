If you have any problems with the `gcode` syntax highlighting, please provide the following in this issue:

1. a screenshot of the syntax highlighting you see
1. copy and paste a large chunk of the gcode for me to play with and test
1. any links to any documentation pertaining to this flavor of gcode syntax
1. explain what formatting or highlighting you would have _expected_ to see
