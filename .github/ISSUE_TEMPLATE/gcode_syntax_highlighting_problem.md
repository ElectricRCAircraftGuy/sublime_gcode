- **OS:** ex: Linux Ubuntu 20.04
- **Version of Sublime Text:** Ex: 4
- **Build number of Sublime Text (Help --> About Sublime Text):** Ex: 4126
- **Color Scheme (Preferences --> Select Color Scheme...):** Ex: Monokai

## 4. Copy and paste a large chunk of the gcode for me to play with and test:

```gcode
;paste large chunk of gcode here
