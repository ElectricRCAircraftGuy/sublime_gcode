Command I used to produce the side-by-side.jpg image:

```bash
montage 1_top_of_file.jpg 2_bottom_of_file.jpg -tile 2x1 -geometry +0+0 side-by-side.jpg
```

Update: I should have just split the file in Sublime Text to get two separate views into it, and then split the screen view vertically down the center to put one on the left and one on the right! That would have been better! :)
